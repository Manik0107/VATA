Generate Manim v0.19 Python code for these scene specifications.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use 'from manim import *' for imports
- Each scene must be a class inheriting from Scene
- Use construct(self) method for scene logic
- Follow Manim v0.19 API (e.g., Write, FadeIn, Transform)
- Include proper Wait() calls for pacing
- Use MathTex for LaTeX formulas
- Output ONLY valid Python code, no markdown, no explanations
- Class names should match scene IDs in PascalCase (e.g., intro -> Intro)
- Make animations engaging with smooth transitions

Scene Specifications:
[
  {
    "id": "intro",
    "title": "Introduction to explain the full concept of linear regression using graphs",
    "goal": "Introduce the topic and establish context",
    "narration": "Welcome! Today we'll explore explain the full concept of linear regression using graphs. ",
    "formulas": [],
    "visuals": "Title animation with topic name"
  },
  {
    "id": "outro",
    "title": "Summary and Conclusion",
    "goal": "Recap key points and conclude",
    "narration": "We've explored explain the full concept of linear regression using graphs, covering the key concepts and formulas. Thank you for learning with us!",
    "formulas": [],
    "visuals": "Summary slide with key takeaways"
  }
]
